The poem, originally titled "The Defence of Fort M Henry," was set to music and became Americas national anthem in 1931. Key was inspired by the sight of the British bombing the fort, which was later set to music by John Stafford Smith. The poem was later referred to as "The Star-Spangled Banner" and was adopted as the national anthem by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. Key died of pleurisy on January 11, 1843. The poem was later set to music and became Americas national anthem in 1931.'

Designed by Igor Sikorsky, it was the first to incorporate a single main rotor and tail rotor design. The first free flight took place on May 13, 1940, and the 28-foot diameter, three-blade rotor allowed for variable pitch of blades with a blade speed of 250 to 300 mph. The VS-300 laid the foundation for the first production helicopters and became the standard for helicopter manufacturing worldwide. Sikorsky submitted a patent application for a direct lift aircraft in 1931, which was granted on March 19, 1935. The VS-300 is on display at the Henry Ford Museum.'

The win also made del Potro the tallest man ever to win a Grand Slam tournament, as he came back from two-sets-to-one down. The event marked the first five-set final since 1999 and the first to run longer than four hours since 1988.'
